Recently, researchers have proposed using Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) as observatories to detect spoofed packets, by leveraging Autonomous System (AS) topology knowledge extracted from Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) data to infer which source addresses should legitimately appear across parts of the IXP switch fabric. We demonstrate that the existing literature does not capture several fundamental challenges to this approach, including noise in BGP data sources, heuristic AS relationship inference, and idiosyncrasies in IXP interconnectivity fabrics. We propose a novel method to navigate these challenges, leveraging *customer cone* semantics of AS relationships to guide precise classification of inter-domain traffic as in-cone, out-of-cone (*spoofed*), unverifiable, bogon, and unassigned. We apply our method to a mid-size IXP with approximately 200 members, and find an upper bound volume of out-of-cone traffic to be more than an order of magnitude less than the previous method inferred on the same data. Our work illustrates the subtleties of scientific assessments of operational Internet infrastructure, and the need for a community focus on reproducing and repeating previous methods.","tags":["Internet Measurements","Network Security","IXP","Spoofing","Customer Cone","BGP","Internet Routing","Reproducibility","Replicability"],"title":"Challenges in Inferring Spoofed Traffic at IXPs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucas Müller","Matthew Luckie","Bradley Huffaker","Kc Claffy","Marinho Barcellos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1568124870,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568124870,"objectID":"444c91731a6fe69843924c89f7156644","permalink":"https://www.lucasmuller.com.br/talk/2019-caida-dust/","publishdate":"2019-09-10T11:14:30-03:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-caida-dust/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Internet Measurements","Network Security","IXP","Spoofing","Customer Cone","BGP","Internet Routing","Reproducibility","Replicability"],"title":"Challenges in Inferring Spoofed Traffic at IXPs","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Pedro Marcos (UFRGS/FURG)","Marco Chiesa (KTH)","Lucas Müller","Pradeeban Kathiravelu (ULisboa and UCLouvain)","Christoph Dietzel (DE-CIX and TU Berlin)","Marco Canini (KAUST)","Marinho Barcellos (UFRGS)"],"categories":[],"content":"Problem\nAutonomous Systems (ASes) can now reach hundreds of networks directly through Internet eXchange Points (IXPs).

As such, ASes prefer long-term agreements at the expense of a potential mismatch between actual delivery performance and current traffic dynamics.

SDN, forwarding devices can only operate correctly while connected to a logically centralized controller. To avoid single-point-of-failure, controller architectures are usually implemented as distributed systems. In this context, recent literature identified fundamental issues, such as device isolation and controller overload, and proposed controller placement strategies to tackle them. However, current proposals have crucial limitations: (i) device-controller connectivity is modeled using single paths, yet in practice multiple concurrent connections may occur; (ii) peaks in the arrival of new flows are only handled on-demand, assuming that the network itself can sustain high request rates; and (iii) failover mechanisms require predefined information, which, in turn, has been overlooked. This paper proposes Survivor, a controller placement strategy that addresses these challenges. The strategy explicitly considers path diversity, capacity, and failover mechanisms at network design. Comparisons to the state-of-the-art on survivable controller placement show that Survivor is superior because (a) path diversity increases the survivability significantly; and (b) capacity-awareness is essential to handle overload during both normal and failover states.","tags":["Software-Defined Networking","enhanced controller placement strategy","SDN survivability","device-controller connectivity","failover mechanisms","Survivor","path diversity","capacity-awareness","Mathematical model"],"title":"Survivor: an Enhanced Controller Placement Strategy for Improving SDN Survivability","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Project: Security for the Future Networks using trusted components, funded by FP7 and CNPq (2011-2014).\nGoal: design a framework to provide secure identification and authentication, data transfer, and privacy in virtual network and clouds.\n","date":1417460850,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417460850,"objectID":"26bb6efa35cd3b25e01274bd8738be5f","permalink":"https://www.lucasmuller.com.br/project/2011-2014-secfunet/","publishdate":"2014-12-01T16:07:30-03:00","relpermalink":"/project/2011-2014-secfunet/","section":"project","summary":"Security for the Future Networks using trusted components (2011-2014).","tags":["network security","cloud","authentication","shared resources","virtual networks","concluded"],"title":"SecFuNet","type":"project"},{"authors":["Lucas Müller","Rodrigo Mansilha (INF/UFRGS)","Leonardo Bays (INF/UFRGS)","Luciano Gaspary (INF/UFRGS)","Marinho Barcellos (INF/UFRGS)"],"categories":[],"content":"Project: GT-UNIT: Observing the BitTorrent Universe Through Telescopes, funded by RNP (2010–2013).\nGoal: development of a monitoring architecture to allow the observation of BitTorrent networks seeking to pinpoint sharing of illegal files (e.g. child pornography) and copyrighted content.\nNowadays, the service is in use by the Incident Response and Security Team at the Brazilian Academic backbone network (RNP).\n","date":1383333115,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1383333115,"objectID":"a7111f04842d5a5558dfd379a798e3a2","permalink":"https://www.lucasmuller.com.br/project/2010-2013-torrentu/","publishdate":"2013-11-01T16:11:55-03:00","relpermalink":"/project/2010-2013-torrentu/","section":"project","summary":"Experimental Service Observing the BitTorrent Universe Through Telescopes (2010-2013).","tags":["BitTorrent","security","network monitoring","copyrighted content","illegal files","concluded"],"title":"GT-UniT","type":"project"},{"authors":["Matheus Lehmann","Lucas Müller","Rodolfo Antunes","Marinho Barcellos"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1349446000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1349446000,"objectID":"4f126bc34e2129b5cde2f4c3ac09a520","permalink":"https://www.lucasmuller.com.br/publication/2012-p2p-lehmann/","publishdate":"2012-10-05T11:06:40-03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2012-p2p-lehmann/","section":"publication","summary":"The significance of BitTorrent motivated various studies focused on modeling and evaluating the protocol characteristics and its current implementations in the Internet.

This paper presents an extensive experimental evaluation to study and quantify potential benefits of OD, such as average download time and topology robustness.

However, the widespread adoption of traditional multicast protocols is still held back by the current Internet structure, where the responsibility for management of multicast groups is distributed among network devices. By using distributed algorithms, such protocols generate delays in processing control groups events. In this paper we propose a clean-slate approach for multimedia multicasting, where the end to end calculation of the best route is performed to decrease delays in group configuration. The prototype developed implements this approach using OpenFlow technology. Results obtained through experimentation show a performance gain in relation to traditional IP multicasting.","tags":["Multicast","SDN","OpenFlow"],"title":"Multiflow: Multicast clean-slate with anticipated route calculation on OpenFlow programmable networks","type":"publication"}]
