We apply our method in three distinct periods to two IXPs, with 200+ and 1,600+ members each, and find an upper bound volume of out-of-cone traffic to be more than an order of magnitude less than the previous method inferred on the same data, revealing the practical importance of customer cone semantics in such analysis. We observed no significant improvement in deployment of Source Address Validation (SAV) in networks using the mid-size IXP between 2017 and 2019. In hopes that our methods and tools generalize to use by other IXPs who want to avoid use of their infrastructure for launching spoofed-source DoS attacks, we explore the feasibility of scaling the system to larger and more diverse IXP infrastructures. To promote this goal, and broad replicability of our results, we make the source code of Spoofer-IX publicly available.","tags":["Internet Measurements","Network Security","IXP","Spoofing","Customer Cone","BGP","Internet Routing","Reproducibility","Replicability"],"title":"Spoofed Traffic Inference at IXPs: Challenges, Methods and Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucas Müller, Ph.D.","Matthew Luckie (University of Waikato)","Bradley Huffaker (CAIDA/UCSD)","Kc Claffy (CAIDA/UCSD)","Marinho Barcellos (UFRGS)"],"categories":[],"content":"A new methodology to accurately classify spoofed traffic in the inter-domain level using heavily aggregated Internet traffic data, revealing the deep subtleties of scientific assessments of operational Internet infrastructure (2016-2020).\n","date":1583422839,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583422839,"objectID":"d2487d94020bf97a607881456ef0148a","permalink":"https://www.lucasmuller.com.br/project/2016-2020-spooferix/","publishdate":"2020-03-05T12:40:39-03:00","relpermalink":"/project/2016-2020-spooferix/","section":"project","summary":"Improving the Accuracy of Spoofed Traffic Inference at Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) (2016-2020).","tags":["Internet Measurements","Network Security","IXP","Spoofing","Customer Cone","BGP","Internet Routing","Reproducibility","Replicability","recent","concluded"],"title":"Spoofer-IX","type":"project"},{"authors":["Lucas Muller (INF/UFRGS)","Rodrigo Oliveira (INF/UFRGS)","Pedro Marcos (INF/UFRGS)","Fabricio Mazzola (INF/UFRGS)","Marinho Barcellos (INF/UFRGS)","Renata Teixeira (INRIA/PARIS)"],"categories":[],"content":"The adoption of network monitoring techniques has culminated in a broad availability of raw data.

Through domain specific languages like P4, network operators can quickly deploy new protocols on forwarding devices, customize their functionality, and develop innovative services. This flexibility comes however with a cost: network-wide security and correctness properties (e.g., isolation, reachability, etc.) become much harder to ensure, because network behavior is now determined by a combination of the control plane-driven configuration and the data plane program that resides on devices (also called switches). Existing network verification tools, which rely on a fixed, invariant model of the data plane, are inadequate for programmable data planes.\nGoal\nResearch new techniques to verify and enforce security properties in data plane networks. The verification techniques we work on extend existing verification tools by automatically generating a data plane model from a P4 program. We also work on adapting existing verification tools to integrate with our dynamically-generated models to verify network configuration updates issued by an SDN controller. We also research novel approaches to ensure that network security properties are satisfied by a network configuration that is based on data plane enforcement.

In this context, recent literature identified fundamental issues, such as device isolation and controller overload, and proposed controller placement strategies to tackle them. However, current proposals have crucial limitations: (i) device-controller connectivity is modeled using single paths, yet in practice multiple concurrent connections may occur; (ii) peaks in the arrival of new flows are only handled on-demand, assuming that the network itself can sustain high request rates; and (iii) failover mechanisms require predefined information, which, in turn, has been overlooked. This paper proposes Survivor, a controller placement strategy that addresses these challenges. The strategy explicitly considers path diversity, capacity, and failover mechanisms at network design. Comparisons to the state-of-the-art on survivable controller placement show that Survivor is superior because (a) path diversity increases the survivability significantly; and (b) capacity-awareness is essential to handle overload during both normal and failover states.","tags":["Software-Defined Networking","enhanced controller placement strategy","SDN survivability","device-controller connectivity","failover mechanisms","Survivor","path diversity","capacity-awareness","Mathematical model"],"title":"Survivor: an Enhanced Controller Placement Strategy for Improving SDN Survivability","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Project:\nSecurity for the Future Networks using trusted components, funded by FP7 and CNPq (2011-2014).\nGoal:\nThe goal of the SecFuNet was to design and develop a coherent security architecture for virtual networks and cloud accesses.

So far, however, no work has investigated Optimistic Disconnect (OD), an ad hoc connection management mechanism widely employed in BitTorrent agents. OD allows a peer to search for “better” neighbors in the swarm by disconnecting peers from the current neighborhood and connecting to others. This paper presents an extensive experimental evaluation to study and quantify potential benefits of OD, such as average download time and topology robustness. We evaluate different scenarios and the impact of factors such as average peer reachability and arrival pattern. We found that OD generally improves the overall performance of the swarm (in up to 30% in the evaluated scenarios), while improving the robustness of its topology.","tags":["optimistic disconnection","protocol characteristics","ad hoc connection management mechanism","BitTorrent","topology robustness","peer reachability","arrival pattern"],"title":"Disconnecting to Connect: understanding Optimistic Disconnection in BitTorrent","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucas Bondan","Lucas Müller, Ph.D.","Maicon Kist"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1338905795,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1338905795,"objectID":"d476eb9520c6d992ca2c026f089af724","permalink":"https://www.lucasmuller.com.br/publication/2012-journalacr-bondan/","publishdate":"2012-06-05T11:16:35-03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2012-journalacr-bondan/","section":"publication","summary":"Increasingly popular, Internet applications for multimedia broadcasting require multipoint communication, in order to reduce network traffic rates. However, the widespread adoption of traditional multicast protocols is still held back by the current Internet structure, where the responsibility for management of multicast groups is distributed among network devices. By using distributed algorithms, such protocols generate delays in processing control groups events. In this paper we propose a clean-slate approach for multimedia multicasting, where the end to end calculation of the best route is performed to decrease delays in group configuration. The prototype developed implements this approach using OpenFlow technology. Results obtained through experimentation show a performance gain in relation to traditional IP multicasting.","tags":["Multicast","SDN","OpenFlow"],"title":"Multiflow: Multicast clean-slate with anticipated route calculation on OpenFlow programmable networks","type":"publication"}]
