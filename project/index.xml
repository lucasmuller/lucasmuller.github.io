However, giving the large-scale and complexity of long-distance networks and the massive volume of distributed data, minor progress has been achieved regarding the in-depth analysis of this collected data and inferences about the network behavior. This project investigates methods to analyze the data measured by the existing monitoring tools present in the &lt;a href="https://www.rnp.br/en/ipe-network" target="_blank">Brazilian Academic IPÊ backbone network&lt;/a>. The result is a service that provides inferences to aid the process of operation, traffic engineering and network planning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dynam-IX</title><link>https://www.lucasmuller.com.br/project/2016-2019-dynamix/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2019 13:07:35 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.lucasmuller.com.br/project/2016-2019-dynamix/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Autonomous Systems (ASes) can now reach hundreds of networks directly through Internet eXchange Points (IXPs). Despite the benefits, any pair of ASes needs first to agree on exchanging traffic. Such process is mainly manual and lengthy. Because of the hassle, ASes miss interconnection opportunities and prefer long-term agreements, even if not matching current Internet traffic dynamics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Approach&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To improve wide-area traffic delivery performance Dynam-IX enables IXP members with a protocol to find interconnection opportunities and establish interconnection agreements, a high-level interconnection intent abstraction to express peering policies, a legal framework to digitally handle contracts, and a distributed tamper-proof ledger to allow ASes to cooperatively build trust.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hidden Dynamics</title><link>https://www.lucasmuller.com.br/project/2017-2018-mshiddendynamics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 14:16:43 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.lucasmuller.com.br/project/2017-2018-mshiddendynamics/</guid><description>&lt;p>Uncovering the Hidden Dynamics of Changing Internet Interconnections.

&lt;p>Securing Networks in the Programmable Data Plane Era, funded by &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1740911" target="_blank">NSF&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.ctic.rnp.br/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1._us-brasil_collaboration_v3.pdf" target="_blank">RNP/CTIC&lt;/a> (2017-2020).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Context&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recent advances in &lt;a href="https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-definition/" target="_blank">Software Defined Networking (SDN)&lt;/a> have expanded our ability to program the network to its data plane. Through domain specific languages like &lt;a href="https://p4.org/" target="_blank">P4&lt;/a>, network operators can quickly deploy new protocols on forwarding devices, customize their functionality, and develop innovative services. This flexibility comes however with a cost: network-wide security and correctness properties (e.g., isolation, reachability, etc.) become much harder to ensure, because network behavior is now determined by a combination of the control plane-driven configuration and the data plane program that resides on devices (also called switches). Existing network verification tools, which rely on a fixed, invariant model of the data plane, are inadequate for programmable data planes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Goal&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Research new techniques to verify and enforce security properties in data plane networks. The verification techniques we work on extend existing verification tools by automatically generating a data plane model from a P4 program. We also work on adapting existing verification tools to integrate with our dynamically-generated models to verify network configuration updates issued by an SDN controller. We also research novel approaches to ensure that network security properties are satisfied by a network configuration that is based on data plane enforcement. We work to develop an in-line monitor, implemented in the data plane itself, that enforces critical security properties, such as isolation and bandwidth limits, even in the presence of a faulty user data plane program or controller.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Network Design</title><link>https://www.lucasmuller.com.br/project/2014-2016-netdesign/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jan 2016 15:53:16 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.lucasmuller.com.br/project/2014-2016-netdesign/</guid><description>&lt;p>Aimed at developing optimization techniques that can be applied both at network design and during its lifespan in order to improve network performance, funded by &lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/azure/" target="_blank">Microsoft Research (Microsoft Azure Research Award)&lt;/a> (2014–2016).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Phoenix</title><link>https://www.lucasmuller.com.br/project/2014-2016-phoenix/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 15:47:45 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.lucasmuller.com.br/project/2014-2016-phoenix/</guid><description>&lt;p>Proposed to investigate and develop an architecture that strengthens current guarantees and coordinates mechanisms to improve survivability, funded by &lt;a href="http://www.cnpq.br/" target="_blank">MCTI/CNPq&lt;/a> (2014–2016).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SecFuNet</title><link>https://www.lucasmuller.com.br/project/2011-2014-secfunet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2014 16:07:30 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.lucasmuller.com.br/project/2011-2014-secfunet/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Project:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Security for the Future Networks using trusted components, funded by &lt;a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html" target="_blank">FP7&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.cnpq.br/" target="_blank">CNPq&lt;/a> (2011-2014).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Goal:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The goal of the SecFuNet was to design and develop a coherent security architecture for virtual networks and cloud accesses. The proposed architecture would provide solutions allowing the management of communications security for all machines connected to a public cloud using virtual networks. This architecture should guarantee security in the virtualized infrastructure, through isolation of virtual networks and access control for users and managers, without compromising authorized users' privacy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GT-UniT</title><link>https://www.lucasmuller.com.br/project/2010-2013-torrentu/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2013 16:11:55 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.lucasmuller.com.br/project/2010-2013-torrentu/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Project:&lt;/strong> GT-UNIT: Observing the BitTorrent Universe Through Telescopes, funded by &lt;a href="http://www.rnp.br" target="_blank">RNP&lt;/a> (2010–2013).&lt;/p>
